            <h3>This are Few of My Favorites</h3>
            <article class="right">
                <p><b>Haikyuu</b>
                    <div>Haikyu is a popular Japanese manga television series. The story follows the story of a young boy naming Shoyo Hinata, who is obsessed with the volleyball game and determined to become a famous volleyball player. As a volleyball player, watching Haikyuu motivates mo to continue playing vvolleyball. Eversince i was in elementary i've been playing volleyball and entered competitions. Likewise to Hinata Shoyo i am also determined to become a professional volleyball player. However, at this point i've come to the point were these things that i use to love to do doesn't matter to me anymore and i lost interest in doing them. Because i jhave a lot of passion in volleyball, i don't want to lose that so that's why i watch haikyuu and other motivational movies that keeps me motivated to do the things i love and to keep on doing them. Also, Haikyuu is a very funny series and at the same time it engages learning.

                <p><b>Headset/Headphones</b>
                    <div>To a lot of people this may seem silly. But to others like me, who struggle on a daily basis to talk to people, using headphones is a big deal. As an introvert who is also a highly sensitive person (HSP), I am often anxious when i am around with people. I can't bring myself to talk to people that's why i often wear headphones.Ideally, headphones symbolizes that a person is busy and they do not want to be bothered. This is why i wear them to avoid people from talking to me or talking to them because if they would start a conversation with me i really don't know how to response or talk with them which makes me anxious and it stresses me out. Also, my thoughts are sporadic and ever-changing based on the moods and actions of the people around me. Being an HSP is a good thing because we can often sense othersâ€™ needs, but it can also be overwhelming.

            <article class="center">
                <p><b>Music</b>
                    <div>This is one of my favoritething to do because it can help treat mental illness and it has the power to change moods and help people process their feelings. If i want a happy mood i can just play music for me to stay happy. This plays an important role in my life because when i have a problem where there are many thoughts in my brains and when i am sad, music helps me to be distracted and not focus on the problem, it helps me not to think about it. There are a lot of reasons why i listen to music but these are few of them.
