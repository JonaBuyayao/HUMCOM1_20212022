<p style="text-align:center;">The Spiritual Journey of Columbine Martyr Rachel Scott is a story of faith told in Rachels own words The book includes first person narratives journal entries drawings from Rachels diary and notes from her parents and friends at Columbine High School.</p>
<i><p style="text-align:center;">The book cover is colored blue with Rachel Scott's smiling picture during his highschool years and its title on the book cover is Rachel's Tears. Its a true story based on Rachel Scott's journal. This book for me personally is a life changer. Its impact is very deep and its one of the best books i have read. The over all story is heart warming, heart breaking, and its just beautiful how Rachel Scott has made an impact to the world with her story.</i>
